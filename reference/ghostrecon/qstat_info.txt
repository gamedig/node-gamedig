Ghost Recon communicates on two UDP ports and one TCP stream.  Normally TCP
is on port 2346 and carries the game dialog.  This is the port number
that is mentioned in the game so we use it and apply an offset to get the
port number for status queries.  Port 2347 gives some high level server stats
and 2348 gives fairly low level server stats.  QStat is designed around
a single port per server so the 2348 port is used.  One down side to this
is the lack of many meaningful detail player stats (Deaths, frags, hit
percentage, ping etc.).  I imagines that some of these are availible in
the TCP stream but that would be difficult to add to a program like QStat.

The Ghost Recon packets are variable structures with a lot of string
lengths.  This requires fairly defensive programming as Red Storm
Entertainment is not forthcoming with any details.

This release adds support for the GhostRecon game.  Number one note
is that Red Storm and UBI do not provide the information that many
Quake based users expect.  Specifically they do not make Frags, Deaths
Connect Time or Pings availible - at least not as far as I can tell.
That said there are quite a few things that are availible and allow a
server administrator to make the status of his or her server available
to the public via the web.

This change uses all undocumented interfaces to the Ghost Recon server
so will most likely break when you install a patch.  It has been tested
against the Desert Seige update and several public servers.  It should
work against the 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 patches and Island Thunder add-on to
Ghost Recon.

The Ghost Recon game type is GRS.  For command-line queries, use -grs

There is one query argument to this server, ignoreserverplayer.
This option controls whether the first player is ignored.  Ghost Recon
requires that the dedicated server program take up one of the player slots
(always the first slot).  The ignoreserverplayer option defaults to 'yes',
so the "server player" will normally not be seen.  If you are running
a non-dedicated server, then set ignoreserverplayer to 'no' like this:

  -grs,ignoreserverplayer=no

Otherwise you would not be able to display your own stats.
