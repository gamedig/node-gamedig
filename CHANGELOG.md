### Breaking Changes
#### Package
* Node.js 16.20 is now required (from 14).
* Made the library a `module`.
* Removed `GameResolver`, moved the `GameDig` class in a separate file.
* Modified exports, now the library exports `games` and `protocols` alongside the `GameDig` class.
  * Many game ids have changed, see the [migrate ids](MIGRATE_IDS.md) file for more info regarding this.
  * A game always has these fields: `name`, `release_year` and `options` (which always contains `port`/`port_query`/`port_query_offset` and `protocol`) and could contain `extra.old_id`.
* `maxAttempts` has been renamed to `maxRetries`.

#### Games
* Almost all games ids have been changed to follow a standard, see [CONTRIBUTING.md#naming](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig/blob/5ae12dd494c927abcbe43352609d9aa34a54753c/CONTRIBUTING.md?plain=1#L27C3-L27C3).
* Removed `minecraftping` (as it was deprecated and the same thing as `minecraft`) and 
`minecraftpe` (deprecated, which is now the same as `mbe` (Minecraft Bedrock Edition)).
* Removed the `games.txt` file, the games definitions are now stored in-code (exported on `games`).

### Other changes
#### Package
* Replaced usage of deprecated `substr` with `substring`.
* Replaced deprecated internal `punycode` with the [punycode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/punycode) package.
* Updated dependencies:
  * [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) from 12.1 to 13.
  * [minimist](https://github.com/minimistjs/minimist) from 1.2.6 to 1.2.8.
  * [long](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js) from 5.2.0 to 5.2.3.
  * @types/node from 14.18.13 to 16.18.58.
  * [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) from 1.0.0-rc.10 to 1.0.0-rc.12.
* Added eslint which spotted some unused variables and other lints.
* CLI: Resolved incorrect error message when querying with a non-existent protocol name.
* Added Deno support: the library and CLI can now be experimentally used with the [Deno runtime](https://deno.com)
  * Minimum Supported Deno Version: `1.39.2`.
  * `deno run --allow-net bin/gamedig.js --type tf2 127.0.0.1`
* Added code examples.
* New stable field: `queryPort` - this number indicates what was the port that the query was done on, 0 indicates none if not applicable.
* Fixed `numplayers` not having a default value.
* New options:
  * `portCache` (defaults to `true`) after you queried a server, the second time you query that exact server (identified by specified ip and port), first add an attempt to query with the last successful port.
  * `stripColors` (defaults to `true`) for protocols that strips colors: unreal2, savage2, quake3, nadeo, gamespy2, doom3, armagetron.
  * `requestRulesRequired` (defaults to `false`) Valve games only. `requestRules` is always required to have a response or the query will timeout.
  * `requestPlayersRequired` (defaults to `false`) Valve games only. Querying players is always required to have a response or the query will timeout. Some [games](GAMES_LIST.md) may not provide a players response.
  * `noBreadthOrder` (defaults to `false`). If multiple attempts are to be made, disable doing one of each type until reaching the retry count.
  * `checkOldIDs` (defaults to `false`). Query will check for older game type IDs. See [migration](MIGRATION.md) document.
* Now documented: `address` (defaults to `undefined`) Override the IP address of the server skipping DNS resolution. When set, host will not be resolved, instead address will be connected to. However, some protocols still use host for other reasons e.g. as part of the query.

#### Games
* Removed the players::setNum method, the library will no longer add empty players as 
placeholders in the `players` fields.
* Valve: dont skip players with no name and keep state.raw.players.

* Clarified that nodejs 12 is now required for gamedig 3
* Fixed misc player fields not going into `raw` subobject in `assettocorsa`, `fivem`, and `gamespy2`

### 3.0.0
Major Changes:
* **NodeJS 12 is now required**
* The `name` field is now guaranteed to exist on all player objects. If a player's name is unknown, the `name` will be an empty string.
* All non-`name` player fields have been moved into a `raw` sub-field. This means that, like the `raw` subobject of the parent
  response, all non-`name` fields are now considered to be unstable and may be changed during minor releases of GameDig.
* "Rules" are no longer queried for `valve` protocol games by default. Many games do not respond to this query anyways (meaning we have to wait
  for timeout), and its contents is often not even used since it only exists in the raw subfield. If you depend on rules,
  you may pass the `requestRules: true` option to re-enable them.
* The `raw.steamappid` and `raw.gameid` fields for valve games have been consolidated into `raw.appId`.

##### Breaking API changes
* **Node 8 is now required**
* Removed the `port_query` option. You can now pass either the server's game port **or** query port in the `port` option, and
GameDig will automatically discover the proper port to query. Passing the query port is more likely be successful in
unusual cases, as otherwise it must be automatically derived from the game port.
* Removed `callback` parameter from Gamedig.query. Only promises are now supported. If you would like to continue
using callbacks, you can use node's `util.callbackify` function to convert the method to callback format.
* Removed `query` field from response object, as it was poorly documented and unstable.
* Removed `notes` field from options / response object. Data can be passed through a standard javascript context if needed.

##### Minor Changes
* Rewrote core to use promises extensively for better error-handling. Async chains have been dramatically simplified
by using async/await across the codebase, eliminating callback chains and the 'async' dependency.
* Replaced `--output pretty` cli parameter with `--pretty`.
* You can now query from CLI using shorthand syntax: `gamedig --type <gameid> <ip>[:<port>]`
* UDP socket is only opened if needed by a query.
* Automatic query port detection -- If provided with a non-standard port, gamedig will attempt to discover if it is a
game port or query port by querying twice: once to the port provided, and once to the port including the game's query
port offset (if available).
* Added new `connect` field to the response object. This will typically include the game's `ip:port` (the port will reflect the server's
game port, even if you passed in a query port in your request). For some games, this may be a server ID or connection url
if an IP:Port is not appropriate.
* Added new `ping` field (in milliseconds) to the response object. As icmp packets are often blocked by NATs, and node has poor support
for raw sockets, this time is derived from the rtt of one of the UDP requests, or the time required to open a TCP socket
during the query.
* Improved debug logging across all parts of GameDig
* Removed global `Gamedig.debug`. `debug` is now an option on each query.

##### Protocol Changes
* Added support for games using older versions of battlefield protocol.
* Simplified detection of BC2 when using battlefield protocol.
* Fixed buildandshoot not reading player list
* Standardized all doom3 games into a single protocol, which can discover protocol discrepancies automatically.
* Standardized all gamespy2 games into a single protocol, which can discover protocol discrepancies automatically.
* Standardized all gamespy3 games into a single protocol, which can discover protocol discrepancies automatically.
* Improved valve protocol challenge key retry process

### 1.0.0
* First official release
* Node.js 6 is now required
